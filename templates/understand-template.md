# Project Understanding: [PROJECT NAME]

**Generated**: [DATE]  
**Purpose**: This document captures the current state of the codebase for projects that were not originally developed using spec-kit. It helps AI agents understand the existing project structure, technology stack, and patterns.

**Note**: This document is auto-generated by the `/speckit.understand` command. Review and update as needed to ensure accuracy.

## Next Steps

After understanding the codebase:

1. **Review this document** for accuracy and completeness
2. **Run `/speckit.constitution`** to establish project principles based on existing patterns
3. **Start using spec-kit** for new features with `/speckit.specify`
